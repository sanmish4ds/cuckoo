finding\\nproperties of numbers we give some examples of these applications below\\nexample 2  show that every positive even integer is of the form 2q and that every\\npositive odd integer is of the form 2q  1 where q is some integer\\nsolution  let a be any positive integer and b  2 then by euclid’s algorithm\\na  2q  r for some integer q ≥ 0 and r  0 or r  1 because 0 ≤ r  2 so\\na  2q or 2q  1\\nif a is of the form 2q then a is an even integer also a positive integer can be\\neither even or odd therefore any positive odd integer is of the form 2q  1\\nexample 3  show that any positive odd integer is of the form 4q  1 or 4q  3 where\\nq is some integer\\nsolution  let us start with taking a where a is a positive odd integer we apply the\\ndivision algorithm with a and b  4\\nsince 0 ≤ r  4 the possible remainders are 0 1 2 and 3\\nthat is a can be 4q or 4q  1 or 4q  2 or 4q  3 where q is the quotient\\nhowever since a is odd a cannot be 4q or 4q  2 since they are both divisible by 2\\ntherefore any odd integer is of the form 4q  1 or 4q  3\\nexample 4  a sweetseller has 420 kaju barfis and 130 badam barfis she wants to\\nstack them in such a way that each stack has the same number and they take up the\\nleast area of the tray what is the number of that can be placed in each stack for this\\npurpose\\nsolution  this can be done by trial and error but to do it systematically we find\\nhcf 420 130 then this number will give the maximum number of barfis in each\\nstack and the number of stacks will then be the least the area of the tray that is used\\nup will be the least\\nnow let us use euclid’s algorithm to find their hcf we have \\n420  130 × 3  30\\n130  30 × 4  10\\n30  10 × 3  0\\nso the hcf of 420 and 130 is 10\\ntherefore the sweetseller can make

have seen that any natural number can be written as a\\nproduct of its prime factors for instance 2  2 4  2 × 2 253  11 × 23 and so on\\nnow let us try and look at natural numbers from the other direction that is can any\\nnatural number be obtained by multiplying prime numbers let us see\\ntake any collection of prime numbers say 2 3 7 11 and 23 if we multiply\\nsome or all of these numbers allowing them to repeat as many times as we wish\\nwe can produce a large collection of positive integers in fact infinitely many\\nlet us list a few \\n7 × 11 × 23  1771 3 × 7 × 11 × 23  5313\\n2 × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23  10626 2\\n3\\n × 3 × 73\\n  8232\\n2\\n2\\n × 3 × 7 × 11 × 23  21252\\nand so on\\nnow let us suppose your collection of primes includes all the possible primes\\nwhat is your guess about the size of this collection does it contain only a finite\\nnumber of integers or infinitely many infact there are infinitely many primes so if\\nwe combine all these primes in all possible ways we will get an infinite collection of\\nnumbers all the primes and all possible products of primes the question is – can we\\nproduce all the composite numbers this way what do you think do you think that\\nthere may be a composite number which is not the product of powers of primes\\nbefore we answer this let us factorise positive integers that is do the opposite of\\nwhat we have done so far\\n201920\\n8 mathematics\\nwe are going to use the factor tree with which you are all familiar let us take\\nsome large number say 32760 and factorise it as shown \\nso we have factorised 32760 as 2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of\\nprimes ie 32760  23\\n × 32\\n × 5 × 7 × 13 as a product of powers of primes let us try\\nanother number say 123456789 this can be written as 32\\n × 3803 × 3607 of course\\nyou have to check that 3803 and 3607 are primes try it out for several other natural\\nnumbers yourself this leads us to a conjecture that every composite number can be\\nwritten as the product of powers of primes in fact this statement is true and is called\\nthe fundamental theorem of arithmetic because of its basic crucial importance\\nto the study of integers let us now formally state this theorem\\ntheorem 12 fundamental theorem of arithmetic  every composite number\\ncan be expressed  factorised as a product of primes and this factorisation is\\nunique apart from the order in which the prime factors occur\\n201920\\nreal numbers 9\\nan equivalent version of theorem 12 was probably first\\nrecorded as proposition 14 of book ix in euclid’s\\nelements before it came to be known as the fundamental\\ntheorem of arithmetic however the first correct proof\\nwas given by carl friedrich gauss in his disquisitiones\\narithmeticae\\ncarl friedrich gauss is often referred to as the ‘prince of\\nmathematicians’ and is considered one of the three\\ngreatest mathematicians of all time along with archimedes\\nand newton he has made fundamental contributions to\\nboth mathematics and science\\nthe fundamental theorem of arithmetic says that every composite number\\ncan be factorised as a product of primes actually it says more it says that given\\nany composite number it can be factorised as a product of prime numbers in a\\n‘unique’ way except for the order in which the primes occur that is given any\\ncomposite number there is one and only one way to write it as a product of primes\\nas long as we are not particular about the order in which the primes occur so for\\nexample we regard 2 × 3 × 5 × 7 as the same as 3 × 5 × 7 × 2 or any other\\npossible order in which these primes are written this fact is also stated in the\\nfollowing form\\nthe prime factorisation of a natural number is unique except for the order\\nof its factors\\nin general given a composite number x we factorise it as x  p1\\np2\\n  pn\\n where\\np1\\n p2\\n pn\\nare primes and written in ascending order ie p1\\n≤ p2\\n≤    ≤ pn\\n if we combine the same primes we will get powers of primes for example\\n32760  2 × 2 × 2 × 3 × 3 × 5 × 7 × 13  23\\n × 32\\n × 5 × 7 × 13\\nonce we have decided that the order will be ascending then the way the number\\nis factorised is unique\\nthe fundamental theorem of arithmetic has many applications both within\\nmathematics and in other fields let us look at some examples\\nexample 5  consider the numbers 4n\\n where n is a natural number check whether\\nthere is any value of n for which 4n\\n ends with the digit zero\\nsolution  if the number 4n\\n for any n were to end with the digit zero then it would be\\ndivisible by 5 that is the prime factorisation of 4n\\n would contain the prime 5 this is\\ncarl friedrich gauss\\n1777 – 1855\\n201920\\n10 mathematics\\nnot possible because 4n\\n  22n\\n so the only prime in the factorisation of 4n\\n is 2 so the\\nuniqueness of the fundamental theorem of arithmetic guarantees that there are no\\nother primes in the factorisation of 4n\\n so there is no natural number n for which 4n\\nends with the digit zero\\nyou have already learnt how to find the hcf and lcm of two positive integers\\nusing the fundamental theorem of arithmetic in earlier classes without realising it\\nthis method is also called the prime factorisation method let us recall this method\\nthrough an example\\nexample 6  find the lcm and hcf of 6 and 20 by the prime factorisation method\\nsolution  we have  6  21\\n × 31 and 20  2 × 2 × 5  22\\n × 51\\n\\nyou can find hcf6 20  2 and lcm6 20  2 × 2 × 3 × 5  60 as done in your\\nearlier classes\\nnote that

The adjective real in this context was introduced in the 17th century by René Descartes, who distinguished between real and imaginary roots of polynomials. The real numbers include all the rational numbers, such as the integer −5 and the fraction 4/3, and all the irrational numbers, such as √2 (1.41421356..., the square root of 2, an irrational algebraic number).\n",
